A jupyter notebook was initially used to develop this tool. The IBIS_to_SPICE_notebook pdf/html files are a snapshot of a first working version of the notebook intended to provide some insight into how the tool was developed.
Please note that the information in these files may not resemble the latest source code, but the working principles should remain the same.
